Starting work on my own, custom, multilingual keyboard layout for my computer.

This guide has been invaluable:

NOTE: Makefile must be run as root. 



The files need to go in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols. I usually prepend
"kechpaja-custom-" to their names.


This is primarily a project for my own convenience. Most importantly, I make no
promises whatsoever that the positions of the various keys will remain the same
in future versions.
